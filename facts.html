          <h3>Physiology</h3>
          <p>
            Bigfoot is often described as a large, ape-like creature said to inhabit remote forests across North America. Reports and folklore suggest it stands between 7 and 10 feet tall, with a muscular, broad-shouldered build and weighing anywhere
            from 600 to over 1,000 pounds. Its body is typically covered in thick, dark hair—ranging from brown to black or reddish—that helps it blend into the forest and withstand cold environments. Witnesses frequently mention long arms, a
            slightly stooped posture, and large hands and feet, which could aid in climbing, digging, or traversing rough terrain. The face is often described as a mix between human and ape, with deep-set eyes and a pronounced brow ridge. While no
            scientific evidence confirms Bigfoot’s existence, enthusiasts theorize that its physiology would make it a powerful, nocturnal omnivore—built for strength, endurance, and survival in some of the most secluded parts of the wilderness.

          <h3>Mythology</h3>
          <p>
            The myth of Bigfoot has captured human imagination for centuries, blending folklore, mystery, and the allure of the unknown. Stories of giant, hairy, human-like creatures date back to Indigenous legends across North America, where tribes
            spoke of “wild men” or forest guardians who lived in harmony with nature. Modern Bigfoot sightings began gaining attention in the mid-20th century, especially after reports of enormous footprints were found in remote areas of the Pacific
            Northwest. Since then, countless tales, photos, and videos have fueled debate over whether Bigfoot is a real, undiscovered species or a cultural phenomenon built on myth and misidentification. Regardless of belief, Bigfoot has become a
            powerful symbol of mystery and wilderness—a reminder that even in a mapped and modern world, there are still legends that keep us wondering what might be out there.
